This personal website is a place for me to show off my accomplishments, enjoy!

When creating my portfolio website, I decided to take this opportunity to learn about how AI can be used as a tool to make coding easier.

To maximize my learning, I decided to design the website from scratch instead of using a website template. With the help of Cursor AI, I built the website using React and Tailwind CSS.

This project gave me a great chance to learn about both web development and how AI can be used as a tool. These two skills will be very useful for my future career.
